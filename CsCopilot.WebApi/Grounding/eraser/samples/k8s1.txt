#Request
The architecture requires a Kubernetes cluster setup that integrates with major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) via a Cloud Provider API, managed by a Control Plane consisting of an API Server, Scheduler, Cloud Controller Manager, Controller Manager, and etcd for cluster state storage. It includes three worker nodes, each equipped with a kubelet and a Kubernetes Proxy, to handle container orchestration and network traffic routing. The Cloud Controller Manager establishes a connection between the cluster and the cloud providers, while the API Server acts as the central management entity, connecting to all other components within the Control Plane and the worker nodes for operational coordination and communication.
