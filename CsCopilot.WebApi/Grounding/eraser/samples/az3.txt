#Request
I want to have a azure architecture diagram for a web application.
I want ot have a subscription with 2 ResourceGroups
In each ResourceGroup place a StaticWebApp called WebApp1, a storage account called Storage1 and a SQL Database called SQL1.
The AppService of each should have a connection to the SQL Database and the Storage Account in their ResourceGroup.
Add a third ResourceGroup called SharedResources with a KeyVault called KeyVault1.
All static web apps should have connection to the KeyVault.
Also create a FrontDoor ResourceGroup with an load balancer called FrontDoor1 which is connected to both StaticWebApps.
